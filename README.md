# An introduction to pipeline tools

This course explains why pipeline tools such as [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/), [snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/short.html) and [targets](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/) are indispensible tools in (reproducible) data analyses.

There is a short lecture [here](presentations/pipeline_tools.html).

There are two folders:

- [this](r_project_blank_slate/) contains a blank R project along with the data in a subdirectory, which can be a starting point for developing a reproducible data analysis
- [this](r_project_done/) contains a completed R project along with the required `_targets.R` file 

## Prerequisites

- basic R skills (although not essential)
- some experience of having done data analysis
