# Difficulties with applied data science

## Question

What are the key problems for you when doing data analysis in research?

## My problems

- Coding mistakes
- Changes to intermediate steps
- New data arrives
- Communicating to others
- Communicating to myself!

## Solutions?

- Coding mistakes: code defensively
- Changes to intermediate steps: have long R / bash scripts that can run things
- New data arrives: see above
- Communicating to others: write extensive comments and put these on the README
- Communicating to myself!: see above

## Problems with the solutions

- Coding mistakes: code defensively: will always make some mistakes
- Changes to intermediate steps: have long R / bash scripts that can run things: will potentially rerun EVERYTHING
- New data arrives: see above
- Communicating to others: write extensive comments and put these on the README: takes time over and above analysis
- Communicating to myself!: see above

# Pipeline tools

## What are pipeline tools?

- Pipeline tools are a way to write executable recipes for producing complex data analyses
- These recipes are humanly readable and useful for communication
- Their ultimate aim is to produce a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that shows how each output of an analysis is produced

## A DAG

[![](figures/make-research-dag.png)](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/make.html)

Taken from ["The Turing Way''](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/make.html).


## What else do they offer?

- The tools track changes to files (code, data etc.)
- If a change is made to an intermediate segment of the code, when you type (something like) `make`, they only rerun downstream analyses

## Existing software

<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/"><img src="figures/gnu-make.png" width="600" height="300" /></a>

Its own language and been around a long time. It tracks changes to files based on time stamps. Can coordinate analyses across virtually any software: R, Python, Mathematica, C, bash and so on

## Existing software

<a href="https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/short.html"><img src="figures/snakemake.jpeg" width="600" height="300" /></a>

Written in Python and favoured by bioinformaticians. It also tracks changes to files based on time stamps. Can coordinate analyses across virtually any software: R, Python, Mathematica, C, bash and so on

## Existing software

<a href="https://books.ropensci.org/targets/"><img src="figures/targets.png" width="250" height="300" /></a>

Written in R and only R specific. Clever way of tracking changes to files that can detect whether those changes will influence outputs. Produces really nice visualisations and is a great learning tool


# An example

## Disclaimer

Willfully taken and amended from the `targets` R package [website](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/walkthrough.html). 

## Aim: develop a model for Ozone versus temperature

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(kableExtra)
library(tidyverse)
library(targets)

kable(airquality[1:20, ], format="html", escape = F) %>% 
  kable_styling() %>%
  kableExtra::scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "400px")
```

## Steps

- Get and clean data
- Fit a model: ozone ~ temperature
- Plot the model's fit versus data
- Diagnose any issues with model fit and, if necessary, repeat steps above

## Demonstration

Go to separate repository!

# Conclusion

## Benefits of pipeline tools

- Improved communication to others and your future self
- Force you to write proper and clean code
- Huge efficiency gains, particularly later on in analyses (i.e. during the crunch period)
